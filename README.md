Just walked out of The Legend of Ochi and, honestly? I kind of feel like I got hit by a bus full of emotions, colors, and I don't know what else. My brain is still digesting the fact that a fox can make me question my life's choices. There's nothing like a rogue fox dragging you through an existential crisis, I guess.

I mean, I went into this whole thing not expecting much, maybe a nice little artsy escape, but left feeling like I just downed 3 cups of espresso while listening to 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 jazz on vinyl. No idea what's going on, but I'm buzzing from it. Somehow, in the chaos of plot twists and awkward silences, I saw bits of myself. Fun.

> Speaking of awkward, why did I start crying during a scene that was supposed to be uplifting? I'm a mess. Maybe just too tired or way too intertwined with this fox's fate. God, there should be a warning label for emotional turbulence.

The music though—ugh, the soundtrack got me in the feels. Notes kind of spun around the scenes like they were weaving some sonic tapestry. I swear at one point, I could almost taste the melody. Is that strange? Probably. But a good strange, like finding a forgotten song on an old playlist.

But can we talk about the lead? That gaze. It's intense, like they actually see you sitting there munching on your overpriced popcorn, judging your entire existence. Acts a bit much at times—I'm just saying. Yet, here I am burrowing my way to find a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥, because of course I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again. Obviously.

Random thought: If foxes could actually solve world hunger, would they accept tips in cookies? No, that makes no sense, ignore me.

All in all, The Legend of Ochi is one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that creeps up on you, gripping your consciousness like a cat clinging to a scratching post. It's makin' me ask big questions about life when all I wanted was to escape. Don't know whether to thank it or throw the popcorn at the screen. But, hey, isn't that the beauty of art? Or maybe I'm just seriously sleep-deprived.
